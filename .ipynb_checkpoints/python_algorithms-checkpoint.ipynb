    "*Action Item: Code the examples in Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures in Python. In particular, become familiar with stacks, queues, linked lists, merge sort, quick sort, and searching and hashing. If you prefer to learn by watching lectures, check out the MIT Introduction to Algorithms course. Bonus: For each algorithm or data structure you learn about, try to program it from scratch in Python, from memory. Many Fellows have also found Leetcode to also be useful in the interview prep for their CS section.*"
