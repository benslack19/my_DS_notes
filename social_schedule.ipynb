    "**Why is it so hard to hang out with us?**\n",
    "\n",
    "My wife and I have enjoyed living in the Bay Area where we've been able to satisfy our love of outdoor activities while being near a cool city. While we're fortunate to have friends and family in the area too, I've felt bad that we haven't been able to hang out with them as often as we'd like. We knew that part of this was due to our work schedules and occasional travel. I basically work a regular M-F schedule, but my wife has a very irregular schedule as a nurse. She \"only\" works three days a week, but those are 12-hour shifts and she's required to work every other weekend. This has limited us going from attending [trivia](https://www.yieldandpause.com/trivia/), [sporting events](https://www.nhl.com/sharks), or just your [average party](https://media.giphy.com/media/wAxlCmeX1ri1y/giphy.gif). In addition, since both of our immediate families are not in the area, we might be hosting or visiting family on weekends that we both have off. While everyone is busy and has commitments, I wanted to quantify how much we could get together socially with our friends in the area. Therefore, in this post, I explore the question: **Given a social time window, what is the probability that we're able to socialize?**"

But trivia is on Tuesdays and others might propose a random happy hour here or there so I think evening get-togethers are fair game. Day time get-togethers are also possible on Saturday and Sunday. On weekends, we could theoretically see some people during the day (a brunch or hike) and others in the evening (dinner or party). That gives us 8 possible time frames in a given week."

I wouldn't have necessarily guessed that it would be this much lower but it makes sense when thinking about it. On weeks where my wife is assigned to weekends, Friday is the only weekday that also decreases in probability of getting together. It's also good to point out that these probabilities are likely overestimates. I didn't account for sick days, errands, family emergencies, or other things that affect our time. From one perspective, we wish we could find more time to get together. But on the other hand, when we do manage to get together, we're grateful for the chance (literally) to do so.\n",
